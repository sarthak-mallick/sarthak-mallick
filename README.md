> Software engineer with 4 years of experience building distributed systems and cloud-native microservices. I care about designing systems that are reliable under load, easy to reason about, and actually solve user problems. Currently pursuing my MS at Northeastern, going deeper on event-driven architectures and AI-assisted development.

## Currently

- 🎓 MS in Computer Software Engineering @ **Northeastern University** (Focus: Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing)
- 🔨 Building distributed systems with Go, Kafka, and Kubernetes
- 🤖 Integrating AI tools (Claude, Codex) into my development workflow
- 📚 Previously: Technical co-lead @ **SAP Labs**, shipping enterprise software at scale

## What I've Built

At **SAP Labs** (2020–2024), I worked on cloud-native enterprise supply chain software:

- **Event-Driven Architecture** — Designed AMQP-based event mesh handling 10K+ async events daily with guaranteed delivery, retry mechanisms, and correlation ID tracing
- **Change Data Capture Framework** — Built a system to track field-level changes and trigger configurable outbound events to external systems based on property mappings
- **High-Throughput APIs** — Developed multi-tenant Node.js microservices with OData RESTful APIs processing 100K+ daily operations
- **Performance Optimization** — Redesigned legacy SQL queries with batching, reducing database calls by 80%
- **Observability** — Instrumented Elasticsearch + Kibana logging with distributed request tracing across services
- **CI/CD** — Set up Jenkins pipelines with containerization, automated testing, and deployment triggers

Also led a 12-member team, conducted 15+ interviews, and ran workshops for 40+ developers on cloud migration.

## Featured Projects

### ☁️ [Cloud Infrastructure & DevOps](https://github.com/sarthak-mallick/Cloud-Infrastructure-DevOps)
Production-grade AWS infrastructure provisioned entirely with **Terraform**.
- VPC networking, load balancer, Route 53 DNS, custom domain with SSL/TLS
- Least-privilege IAM policies, encryption at rest and in transit, security groups
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions + Packer for AMI creation
- Automated test suites, gated promotions, rolling deployments (zero-downtime)
- CloudWatch agents, StatsD metrics, dashboards with health checks and CPU-based auto-scaling
- Achieved **99.9% uptime** through proactive monitoring and automated recovery

### 🚀 [Distributed Real-Time Task Queue](https://github.com/sarthak-mallick/Distributed-Task-Queue)
Asynchronous job execution system built with **Go** and **React**.
- Contract-first data plane: Kafka events, Redis status model, MongoDB result schema, RabbitMQ request-reply with correlation IDs
- GraphQL + WebSocket subscriptions for typed, no-polling real-time updates
- gRPC communication between API and workers
- Hardened reliability: retry/backoff, reconnect handling, graceful shutdown, job_id/trace_id observability
- Dockerized Kubernetes deployment scaffolding
- 
### 📋 [Project Management System](https://github.com/sarthak-mallick/Project-Management)
Full-stack JIRA-inspired application using **Java Spring Boot** MVC.
- Hibernate ORM with MySQL, deployed on Apache Tomcat
- Real-time UI updates with JSP frontend and AJAX
- Security: authentication, server-side validation, SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- Session management with interceptor-based access control
- Post-Redirect-Get pattern to prevent duplicate form submissions

## Background

- **4 years** at SAP Labs building cloud-native SaaS microservices
- Led a **12-member team** as technical co-lead within a 150-member org
- Designed event-driven systems handling **10K+ async events daily**
- Built APIs processing **100K+ operations daily**
- **MS** @ Northeastern University (Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing, Enterprise Software Design)
- **BTech in CS** @ IIT Bombay

## Other Projects

- **Reversi Game Solver** — Java AI using Monte Carlo Tree Search with configurable depth and strategic heuristics
- **Buy-Sell-Auction App** — Full-stack Android app with Flutter/Dart frontend, Java servlet backend, PostgreSQL
- **Custom C Compiler** — Lexer (Lex), parser (Yacc), AST, control flow graph, symbol table, MIPS assembly codegen
- **ML Algorithms** — K-means clustering, ridge/lasso regression, bagging/boosting, MDP value iteration (Python/NumPy)
